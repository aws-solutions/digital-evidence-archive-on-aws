## Deploying code changes

Navigate to DEA root directory and follow instructions in [README](../../../README.md)

## Running locally

First, run the https proxy so your cookies will work:
```sh
rushx dev:https
```
In a separate tab or process, run the development server:

```sh
rushx dev
```

Open [https://localhost:3001](https://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result. You'll need to navigate further to /{stage}/ui, e.g. [https://localhost:3001/devsample/ui](https://localhost:3001/devsample/ui)

The UI running locally will be configured to point to your deployed backend via the DEA_API_URL environment variable, which will be copied into a generated [.env.local](.env.local) for use by Nextjs.

You can generate cognito tests users by following the directions here:
([Test User Generation for API requests](../../README.md)) you will be redirected to the UI which will now have credentials.

## Design system

For the design system we are using Cloudscape. More information can be found [here](https://cloudscape.design/).

#### Common issues

If ports 3000 or 3001 are already in use. Use the `npx kill-port` command to clear the port before running the https proxy or development server

example: `npx kill-port 3000`
